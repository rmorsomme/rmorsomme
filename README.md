- 👋 Hi, my name is Raphael Morsomme and I am a Ph.D. student in statistics at Duke University.
- 👀 I am working on inferential algorithms for partially observed stochastic process. At the moment, I am developping an efficient DA-MCMC algorithm for conducting inference on the stochastic SIR model with incidence data.
